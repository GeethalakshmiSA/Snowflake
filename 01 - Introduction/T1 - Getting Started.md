# Getting Started to Snowflake

* Snowflake - An Advanced cloud platform is provided as a SAAS (software as a service)
* Snowflake enables data strorage, processing and analytic solutions which is more flexible than traditional offering
* Not built based on any existing database or big data technology like Hadoop

## Snowflake as Cloud Service

* Snowflake runs completely on Public Cloud Infrastructure, so
  - No hardware (virtual or physical) to select, install, configure or manage
  - No virtaul software to install, configure or manage
  - No Ongoing maintenance, management, upgrades or tuning
* Snowflake cannot run on any private cloud (on-premises or hosted)
* Snowflake uses virtual compute instance & storage for it's needs
* So, we say, Snowflake is built from scratch and optimized for cloud
* Majorly, here the Storage and Compute are decoupled which serves the pay-only-use model
